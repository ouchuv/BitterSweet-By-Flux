Key Features Of BitterSweet By Flux:
Up to 8 channels Input/output
Output Gain
Controls the Output Gain at the end of the processing (-/+ 12 dB).
Link to Output Gain – Compensates the Output Gain depending on the Transient Amount to achieve unity gain.
Moreover, True bypass control routing the incoming signal direct to the output for a smooth transition between clean and process signal
However, Transient Amount – Adjusting the Bitter/Sweet setting for decreasing or increasing the transients.
In addition, Transient Integration – Provides three different modes of transient processing; Fast, Medium, and Slow
Similarly, Period – For setting the range of the time window used to detect the transients that will be processed.
Above all, Three different Operation Modes (Main, Center, and Stereo) offer versatile transient processing.
Open Sound Control Support
With an integrated M / S encoder/decoder, the middle (middle) or side (stereo) parts of the sound can be processed independently of each other.
Main – process with a normal stereo signal pattern and the only mode available for multi-channel operations
Center – Activates the internal MS encoder and processes only the middle channel. After processing, the sound is decoded to stereo (useful for snare/bass drums).
Stereo – Activates the internal MS encoder and processes only the side channel. After processing, the sound is decoded into stereo. (Effective for curve rhythm instruments).
